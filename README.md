# ArithmeticTree
This repository contains a project developed as part of the IT-Automotive study at DHBW Stuttgart. It is a submission for the Algorithms and Complexity course.

## Description

The ArithmeticTrees project focuses on parsing arithmetic expressions as binary trees in three different representations: prefix, infix, and postfix. The main objective is to build the arithmetic tree based on the input expression and evaluate its result, along with determining the number of nodes and the depth of the tree.

### Class Diagram

The project follows the following class diagram:
