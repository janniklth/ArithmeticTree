# ArithmeticTree
This repository contains a project developed as part of the IT-Automotive study at DHBW Stuttgart. It is a submission for the Algorithms and Complexity course.

## Description

The ArithmeticTrees project focuses on parsing arithmetic expressions as binary trees in three different representations: prefix, infix, and postfix. The main objective is to build the arithmetic tree based on the input expression and evaluate its result, along with determining the number of nodes and the depth of the tree.

### Class Diagram

The project follows the following class diagram:

### Features

- Parsing arithmetic expressions in prefix, infix, and postfix notation.
- Building binary trees from the parsed expressions.
- Evaluating the result of the arithmetic tree.
- Determining the number of nodes in the tree.
- Calculating the depth of the tree.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the ArithmeticTrees project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/janniklth/ArithmeticTrees.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ArithmeticTrees`

### Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
2. Configure the input arithmetic expression in the desired notation.
3. Run the program to parse the expression, build the arithmetic tree, and evaluate the result.
4. View the output, which includes the evaluated result, the number of nodes, and the depth of the tree.
